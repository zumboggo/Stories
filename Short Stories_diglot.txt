无家可归的流浪汉与那只鸽子
"""The Homeless Man and the Pigeon""

老王无家可归，每天晚上都会在公园长椅上睡着。他最宝贵的东西是他那台已经没电的收音机。
Old Wang was homeless, sleeping on a park bench every night. His most valuable possession was a broken radio with dying batteries.

有一天，一只瘸了腿的鸽子在他旁边。王把最后一片面包掰成了两半。“这里我们分享吧。”
One day, a limping pigeon landed beside him. ""You hurt too?"" Wang broke his last piece of bread in half. ""Here, we'll share.""

早上 pigeon 巧Return了——带着一迭 lottery ticket 在嘴中！Wang 次次都开心地 笑出了声，最终 赢得了两万美元！
Next morning, the pigeon returned—with a lottery ticket in its beak! Wang scratched it off laughing... and won $20!

“你好鸟！”王买了面包、电池和配对的小帽子给它们俩。那只鸽子在红帽子上挺着胸，仿佛在王肩上威风凛凛的一样。
""Good bird!"" Wang bought bread, batteries, and matching tiny hats for them both. That pigeon strutted in its red hat like a general on Wang's shoulder.

他们成为了街头名人。游客拍照："看！抓到那种幸运的鸽子！"有人出价100美元购买它。
They became street celebrities. Tourists took photos: ""Look! The lottery-finding pigeon!"" Someone offered $100 to buy it.

王摇摇头。“他不是我的鸽子。我是他的人类。”
Wang shook his head. ""He ain't my pigeon. I'm his human.""

那夜，那只鸟没回来。王叔叔一直搜索，终于在垃圾桶后面找到了它——被打断了，当时有人想偷票。
That night, the bird didn't return. Wang searched until he found it behind a dumpster—beaten by someone trying to steal tickets.

王拥抱着鸽子度过了一个夜晚。破晓时分，鸽子啄了他一下手指，然后安寂下来。
Wang cradled the pigeon all night. At dawn, it pecked his palm once... then went still.

他花光了最后的钱买了一把铁锹，埋在那个公园最美的树下。然后他打开收音机，放着一支旧曲子：《朋友一起走过一生》
He spent his last dollars on a shovel, burying it under the park's nicest tree. When he turned on his radio, an old song played: ""Friends walk through life together...""

第二天，一块木头做的牌子挂在长椅上，画着一只戴红色头巾的鸽子。不知为何，王的收音机电池用的时间特别长。韦德（Weed）的角色相当微弱，几乎没有什么特别之处。五小时后——活力增长了1点。敏捷增长了1点。这两个属性几乎同时提升了。哦，吁气。韦德终于放下木剑休息了一会儿。没吃没喝的情况下，他已经连续将近八个小时一直在击打那个 scarecrow 了。 他感到身体疲劳，情况更糟糕的是，他的咽喉口渴感灼烧，胃部空虚且空洞。他说：“商品清单窗口。”按照预设的关键字，半透明的商品图片在Weed的商品清单窗口上漂浮，清晰地映照着他所拥有的一切物品的影像。
Next day, a wooden sign appeared on the bench, painted with a red-hatted pigeon. And somehow, Wang's radio batteries lasted unusually long after that..." Weed’s avatar was so feeble that there was nothing remarkable. Five hours later— Vitality rises by 1 point. Agility rises by 1 point. The two stats rose almost at the same time. “Whew.” Weed finally put down the wooden sword and took a short break. Without eating or drinking, he had been hitting the scarecrow for nearly eight straight hours. He was physically fatigued, and worse, his throat was burning with thirst, his stomach empty and hollow. “Inventory window.” Given the preset keyword, the semitransparent images of all the belongings in Weed’s inventory floated in front of his eyes.

在他的储物包里，有一个水壶和十片rye面包。在皇家大道上，你需要自己获取所需的东西。其他用户通过完成四周的简单任务来赚取收益，但Weed根本没时间去浪费。他拿出一片rye面包和水壶，并咬了一口面包。吃东西让他满足了自己的 hunger，因此他的满意度有所提升。“每五个小时我必须吃一次饭。” 如果我锻炼得非常剧烈，我吃得多些较好，但我不必把满足感提高到最大。我只要做到远离死亡就行了。” weed吃完晚饭后迅速握着木剑站到了 scarecrow 前面。
Inside his inventory were a canteen and ten pieces of rye bread. In Royal Road, you have to get hold of what you need on your own. Other users make money by carrying out easy quests for the four weeks, but Weed could not spare even a minute. He took out a piece of rye bread and the canteen, and nibbled a mouthful of bread. As he ate food, it appeased his hunger and the satisfaction factor rose. “I’m supposed to have a meal every five hours. I’d better eat more often if I exercise intensely, but I don’t need to raise the satisfaction factor to the full. All I need to do is just stay away from death.” Once Weed finished the meal swiftly, he took the wooden sword in his grip and stood in front of the scarecrow.

“他又来了。” “他疯了。” “我以为他对它有不满或什么的。” “我不认为他会停止，直到他把那座木人拆成碎片。” 这个时候，木人看起来是不是真的在颤抖？weed那根木剑挥舞着，重重地打向木人。所有的观众都面露困惑：这只木人为什么会在此时战栗呢？weed的木剑砍在木人的各个部位，每一次打击，似乎都能让对方应声倒下。 “为什么那个人砸那个 scarecrow？”“我猜这帮人肯定不会帮上忙——如果要提高某个专业技能的等级，最好的办法是去外面实践而不是在这里对着这个 scarecrow 演示。”“看那家伙在那儿晃悠，一点都不会。”
“He’s at it again.” “He’s nuts.” “I think he holds a grudge against it or something.” “I don’t think he’ll stop until he breaks that scarecrow into pieces.” Was it an illusion that the scarecrow looked like it shivered at that very moment? Weed’s wooden sword struck every inch of the scarecrow. The same type of questions arose among all the spectators. “Why the heck is that guy striking the scarecrow?” “I don’t think it will help at all—if he wants to raise the expertise rating for a skill, it’s much better to go out to the field and use it on a rabbit than the scarecrow here.” “Look at what he’s doing. He’s not using any skill.

对我来说，看起来更像是他在冲动之下打碎了那个纸人。”“也许他是在提起自己的数据吧”，身着闪亮甲胄的骑士立刻说道，不加思索地吸引了现场所有人的眼球，“你只是单纯地攻击那个纸人就能提升数据吗？”一个黑皮肤的长枪手问道。“哦？是那样啊。”骑士回答道，“那为什么不单纯一直攻击那个纸人，而不是拼命地提高等级呢？”长枪手再次质问道。 骑士以名Pluto有点高水平，因此他从可靠来源获得了大量信息。他也是唯一一个正确猜出了Weed行为动机的人。
To me, it looks more like he’s beating up the scarecrow on impulse.” “Maybe he’s bringing up his stats,” a knight in dazzling armor commented, immediately attracting the attention of everyone else on the scene. “Can you improve your stats by just hitting the scarecrow?” a dark-skinned ranger asked. “Huh? Ah, yes, that’s right,” the knight said. “Then, why don’t you just keep hitting a scarecrow instead of sweating hard to raise your level?” the ranger asked again. The knight named Pluto had a considerably high level, so he has learned a wealth of information from reliable sources. He was also the only man who correctly guessed the motive of Weed’s actions.

如果一个角色耗尽了他的 stamina（ stamina），那么他的 vitality（活力）和 stamina（ stamina）会随之提升；而一个魔法师如果使用大量的法术，那么他的 wisdom（智慧）和 intelligence（智能）也会有所增长。然而，这种提升相比通过升级获得的 stat bonus points 来说显得微不足道。连续一段时间攻击一个靶子而不休息可能会让 stats 提升一两个点。考虑到升级后获得的 stat bonus points 数量为五，Weed 所做的事情看起来就很傻瓜。 “真的好傻。”  
一个女巫听到Pluto的解释后，轻轻摇头。但她却认为这是正确的。“它确实有效”，Pluto回答。“你能从杀比你弱的怪兽身上获得很少的经验点数吗？”
If an avatar uses up his stamina, his vitality and stamina will develop as a consequence, and if a wizard casts a great many spells, his wisdom and intelligence will rise. But such an increase is trivial compared to stat bonus points accompanied by a level up. Half a day of hitting a scarecrow without a rest might yield one or two stats. Considering that the number of stat bonus points as reward for a level up is five, what Weed was doing looked idiotic. “It really is silly.” A sorceress shook her head when she heard Pluto’s explanation. But he thought otherwise. “It works,” Pluto said. “Excuse me?” “You can earn only small amount of experience points if you kill a weaker monster than your current level.

你知道吗？当然。换言之，级别越高，升阶越难。但如果能在初级阶段通过这种训练提升实力，那么后期狩猎怪物会更轻松。这种方法会在整个游戏中发挥作用。您知道这个方法吗？看来你也接受过类似的训练。其实不然。即便大家都知道了，也没人愿意这样做。 “回到重点，还有人坚持每天对着那个 weakest opponent 的 scarecrow 打击一整天，仅仅为了提升 strength 一点点吗？”“……”“针对 strength，我觉得大概只能提高四十多一点。”
You know that, right?” “Of course.” “In other words, the higher your level is, the harder it is to gain a level. But if you improve your strength by undergoing such a drill in the initial phase, you can hunt monsters easier later on. It will take effect throughout the game.” “You know this method, so I guess you went through the same training? No, wouldn’t everyone do the same if they knew about it?” “Not really. Even if people knew, no one would do it. Back to the point, is there anyone who wants to keep hitting that scarecrow for ten hours to improve their strength by one point?” “…” “There are limits to how far you can increase your stats by working on a scarecrow that’s known as the weakest opponent. In the case of strength, I estimate it’s forty or so.

有人想要至少一个月不停地打那个 scarecrow，提升40点力量？我一定会觉得枯燥乏味，几天后就会放弃。观众们齐声点头同意：比起 month 一直不停歇地打那个 scarecrow 只为了提升40点力量，大家宁愿找把酷炫的武器。提升40点力量的东西虽然独一无二，却远非稀有。这个方法只能让那些无法突破围墙限制的新手有效果。 过去曾很流行打这个 scarecrow，但很快就抛弃了，因为长远来看，这样做实在是太无聊、太费劲了。韦德听到了周围人激烈讨论的场景。
Is there anyone who wants to keep hitting the scarecrow for at least a month to raise forty points in strength? I would get sick and tired of it, and give it up in days.” The crowd watching Weed nodded in unison. You’d rather look for a cool weapon than to strike a scarecrow ceaselessly for a full month in order to bring up your strength by forty points. An item that keeps up strength by forty points is unique, yet far from rare. “This works only for newbies who can’t go beyond the walls. It was once popular to beat a scarecrow like this, but it was quickly abandoned because, when you weigh against it what you can get in the long run, it’s way too boring, and painstaking.” Weed overheard the heated discussion that those around him were having.

他希望能去别的地方训练，但只要他不能离开 Citadel，他就无法避免在大厅招致不受欢迎的注意。你认为这无聊且费力吗？Weed挥舞长剑全力攻击。如果勤奋努力，你的角色会一步步变得更强大。当你的角色进化后，它可以打败更强的怪兽并获得更多的收益。对于Weed来说，这是他一生中最令人兴奋的事情。 weed天生对重复的体力劳动有倾向。这段时间里，教官一直用惊喜的目光看着他。三个星期过去了。weed每日登录Royal Road，除最少的睡眠时间外，已经达到了上瘾。
He wished he could have trained somewhere else, but so long as he wasn’t allowed to leave the Citadel, he could not avoid attracting unfavorable attention in the Hall. What makes you call this boring and painstaking? Weed swung the wooden sword at full strength. If you work hard, your avatar gets stronger step by step. When your avatar evolves, it can defeat stronger monsters and make more money. For Weed, this was the ultimate entertainment in his lifetime. Weed was inherently inclined to routine physical labor. All this time, the instructor was watching him with awfully gratified eyes. Three weeks had passed. Weed logged on to Royal Road on a daily basis, except for minimum sleeping hours, to the point of addiction.

他当时身体状况很好，为此他早已制定好了在开始游戏前锻炼身体的计划。现在回想过去的这三周，仅想一想都让他感到不舒服。当他登录游戏后，他平均每天要花80个小时用单调的方式打击 scarecrow，这已经让他的思维变得迟钝了。如果不是 pop-up 消息鼓励他的话，恐怕他会中途放弃。力量提升1点，敏捷提升1点。 新技能：战斗精神。新技能：续航力。在皇家道路中，除了原有技能外，有时还会新增一个技能。战斗精神：暂时召唤超凡力量，或以一己之力击败较弱的敌人。
His physical condition, which he had resolved to build up before he started the game, enabled him to sleep no more than four hours a day. Now that he looked back at the last three weeks, it made him sick to even think of it. Once he signed into the game, he spent eighty hours on average striking the scarecrow monotonously, which had mentally worn him out. Had it not been for pop-up messages encouraging him, he would have given up. Strength rises by 1 point. Agility rises by 1 point. New stat: Fighting Spirit. New stat: Sustenance. In Royal Road, a new stat is sometimes created besides the original ones. Fighting Spirit: You can call on superhuman strength temporarily, or bring weaker monsters to their knees with a force in your eyes alone.

你被禁止给这个属性分配经验加成。它会自发增长，这取决于角色的行动，尤其是长时间与怪物战斗，或者经常面对比自己水平更高的怪物。技能相关的提示信息有时也会出现。当时Weed的唯一技能就是剑法大成。剑法大成3级：使用剑增加攻击力（+30% ATK），并提高攻击速度（+9% ATK SPD）。 Sustenance: 在行动中，您可能不会消耗太多 stamina。对于这个属性，您不得将其 stat 补充点分配到这里。每当弹出消息时，Weed 秘密地感到自豪，因为他取得了进展。
You are prohibited from distributing stat bonus points to this stat, and it rises spontaneously, depending on the avatar’s action, especially if you fight monsters for a long time, or often confront monsters stronger than your current level. Pop-up messages related to the skill occasionally appeared, too. The only skill Weed had at that point was Sword Mastery. Sword Mastery Lv.3: Increases Attack Power with a sword (+30% ATK), Increases Attack Speed with a sword (+9% ATK SPD). Sustenance: You are likely to use less stamina in action. You are prohibited from distributing stat bonus points to this stat. Every time a pop-up message appeared, Weed was secretly delighted by the progress he was making.

但是让他深感困扰的是，他对自己进步缓慢感到沮丧。在过去三周里，尽管他致力于击败这些“恶人”，但他身体素质的提升仅增加28分，敏捷性提高25分，活力则只增长了22分。“除非我加快速度，否则即使限制措施结束后，我也要花更多宝贵的时间在这儿耗时费力。我必须在离开 Citadel之前完成它。”Weed眼中燃烧着决心。 这下可好。就在那时，Weed的肚子决定该吃饭了。尽管他的统计进度缓慢，但他对缺面包感到苦恼。他可以跑向附近的一个喷泉，给食堂添水，但是面包不同——他得花钱买。嗅一嗅。
But what was deeply troubling him was a sense of frustration that he had been falling behind in his goals. For the last three weeks, as he devoted himself to beating down the scarecrows, his strength had increased only by twenty-eight points, agility twenty-five, and vitality twenty-two. “Unless I pick up my pace, I’ll end up wasting more precious time on this scarecrow even after the restriction is lifted. I must finish it before I can leave the Citadel.” Weed’s eyes burned with determination. Rumble. At that moment, Weed’s stomach decided it was time to eat. Aside from slow progress with his stats, he was tormented by the fact that he was running out of bread. He could run to a nearby fountain and fill the canteen with water, but bread was different – he had to pay money for it. Sniff.

他闻到了一股令人垂涎的香味。weed拿出木剑停顿了一下，转过身 glimpsed(瞥见)了指导员的面庞。指导员正在装着午餐出来午休。 weed wagged他的尾巴。 “哈哈！尊敬的指导员。” weed走到指导员面前。“这是谁？就是 weed-nim吗？你来了这儿做什么？”指导员热情地问道。“难道独自吃饭会很孤单？我随时都在这里为你服务，”weedsequentially（恭敬地）答道。 他的肚子咕噜叫着，Weed故作镇定，却无法蒙骗老师。“您既然 hunger 了，那就坐在我旁边吧！我带了不少食物，足够养活两个人！”“Thank you, sir.”“Mr. Weed，您别总是表现出谦卑！”
He smelled an appetizing scent coming from somewhere. Weed, swinging the wooden sword, paused and caught a glimpse of the instructor, who was taking out his lunchbox for the lunch break. “Hehe, Honorable Instructor.” As Weed wagged his invisible tail, he walked to the instructor. “Hmm, who is this, none other than Weed-nim? What has brought you here?” the instructor said warmly. “Wouldn’t it be lonely to have lunch alone? I am here to keep you company,” Weed said obsequiously. Growl. While his stomach growled, Weed lied with a straight face, but he could not deceive the instructor. “I take it that you are hungry. Sit beside me! I have brought plenty of food, sufficient to feed two mouths.” “Thank you, sir.” “Enough with your humility!

作为荣誉，我为您准备了一份晚餐， weed-nim。我向您保证，您的大名迟早会传遍萨拉伯堡城堡。那一天到来时，请记下了我！ “是的，先生。我一定做到。” Weed轻声奉承导师后，与他共进午餐。这是一幅让人感慨万千的画面，然而，由于 effortless便填饱了肚子，他甚感庆幸。 与一个人工智能NPC smooth-talk有何大不了？除了weed在过去四周里击败了那个 scarecrow之外，他还与教官建立了亲和力。这种额外效果略具含意。
It is my honor to serve a meal to a would-be great adventurer like you, Weed-nim. I assure you that your reputation will someday resound beyond the bounds of the Citadel of Serabourg. When that day comes, please remember me!” “Yes, Sir. I certainly will.” After flattering the instructor lightly, Weed enjoyed lunch together with him. It was kind of a sad scene, yet he was grateful that with little effort, he could stuff his belly. He wasn’t sucking up to a real man, anyway. What was the big deal about smooth-talking an NPC with artificial intelligence? Beside the stats that Weed had increased while beating the scarecrow for the last three weeks, he established an affinity with the instructor. This supplementary effect was somewhat admirable.

在 Weed正津津有味地吃着午饭时，老师突然问道：“ weed-nim，你们说雕塑大师兄，你有什么看法？”“What do you mean by Sculpture Mastery?” 老师问。“I am merely curious of your opinion. I wonder what sort of view you have about Sculpture Mastery in general,” the instructor said。老师只是好奇地想知道你的看法，我也不知道雕塑大师兄是什么意思。” weed脑中闪现出一幅画面。“老师说的时候，weed的脑海中闪现出一幅画面。 他想：到目前为止，我已经发现这位教官是个近视的、简单-minded的人。他认为刀是万能的，对他说来说，最崇高的武德就是能够在训练厅里拼命地打，汗水都流出来了。而现在，他在问我对雕塑功法有什么想法吗？
While Weed was busy devouring lunch, the instructor suddenly asked, “By the way, Weed-nim, what do you think of Sculpture Mastery?” Sculpture mastery? What the heck is sculpture mastery? Weed chewed a mouthful of boiled rice and swallowed it before he asked back, “What do you mean by Sculpture Mastery?” “I am merely curious of your opinion. I wonder what sort of view you have about Sculpture Mastery in general,” the instructor said. At that moment, Weed’s brain raced. He thought: I’ve so far figured out that the instructor is a simple-minded and nearsighted guy. He sincerely believes that the sword is invincible, and to him, it’s the highest virtue to exercise hard enough to break out in a sweat in the Training Hall. And now he’s asking me what I think about Sculpture Mastery?

weed在收集自己的思绪后，皱起眉头。 “有德之师！我简直不敢相信您竟然提起了这件事。我是刀剑大师，难道您问过我的意见吗？上帝愿您保佑我把！我对这回 extremely disappointed. 这是我的回答——无论多少次、永远都不会有如此低级的技艺来自我的高尚心灵。”尽管weed语气尖刻，在别的场合下这肯定会激怒他，但老师却意外地以高兴的手势回应了他。 “我料到了你会这么说！” “无庸置疑的是，雕塑大师这样的杰作无非是上帝的错误，根本不值得我们花费哪怕一分钟的时间去注意。”
As soon as Weed collected his thoughts, he frowned. “Honorable Instructor! I can’t believe you even mentioned it. I am a man of the sword. Did you ask for my opinion upon, God forgive me, Sculpture Mastery? I am most disappointed. This is my answer—never, ever, not even once has such a lowly handicraft crossed my noble mind.” Despite Weed’s offensive tone, which would have enraged him in other situations, the instructor unexpectedly clapped his hands in delight. “I knew you would say so!” “It is out of question. The likes of Sculpture Mastery are nothing but awful mistakes of God which do not deserve a second of our attention.

“为什么，一个持刀的人，我为什么要想到这件事？”“ weed-nim，你真是个令人讨厌的家伙。” Weed 能感觉到，尽管他看不见，但他的友谊与教练之间的感情在那一刻已经升华到一个新的高度。这就是交朋友的方法：你不需要为他们流血，不用浪费时间和金钱在他们身上。你只需在他们一开口之前就批评他们几句，他们就会帮你同情他们。 Weed 期待老师改变主题，但他揉了揉后脑勺，继续讨论同样的话题。“据说一位掌握了雕塑技艺的陌生人曾雕刻过月光，”老师说道，“我怀疑吧，先生。谣言总是容易失真。”
Why do I, a man of the sword, need to ever think of it?” “You are most agreeable, Weed-nim.” Weed sensed that, though it was invisible, his friendship with the instructor moved to a higher degree at that moment. This is the way to make friends with somebody. You don’t need to shed blood with them. You don’t need to squander time and money on them. You just join them in speaking ill of something at the first opportunity, and it will invoke their sympathy. Weed expected the instructor to change the topic, but he rubbed the back of his head and stayed on the subject. “It is rumored that the unknown man who mastered sculpture once carved the moonlight,” the instructor said. “I doubt it, sir. A rumor is always prone to distortion.

如何靠无用的雕塑精通雕刻出月光？或许那是一块月亮形状的鹅卵石”，weed愉快地说。“你这样认为吗？不过我prepend说的。他的美名是梅莉尔，目前是皇家骑士。”雕塑被看作是毫无价值的技艺，只是修剪一块小木头，制作精致的装饰。 听谣传，若将这门技艺推进到某一阶段，便能够制造金属 projectile武器。但它无异于一种已经失传的技艺，自然不会有人去学习了。

但我现在又想到，既然这样，那“雕塑之法”也并非真正的技艺吗？
How can anyone learned in worthless Sculpture Mastery carve the moonlight? Perhaps it was a pebble in the shape of a moon,” Weed said cheerfully. “You think so, too? But I was told by my predecessor. His honorable name is Mellium, currently a Royal Knight…” Sculpture was perceived as a fruitless skill, no more than trimming a small block of wood to produce a fine ornament. Rumor had it that if you elevated the craft beyond a certain stage, you would be capable of making projectile weapons of metal. But it was undoubtedly one of those obsolete skills that nobody bothered learning. “On that account Weed-nim, this question of Sculpture Mastery intrigues me.

“绝对不可能有对手，无论在什么情况下，它都不能与我们的剑相提并论。”但是，你能不能查证一下这个谣言到底有没有半点真知灼见？我之所以打这个电话向你求教，是因为你是一个值得信赖的人。如果你答应我的请求，我非常乐意听取你的意见。 weed 眼睛前方出现了一个 弹出窗口：  
**任务名称:** 未完成。  
任务描述: 传言有位精通雕刻艺术的人曾在 Rosenheim 王国的宫殿中刻画明月，这一传言已经流传了很长时间。  
难度等级: E  
任务要求: quest 要求要求：仅限那些没有获得雕刻 mastery 的人与导师保持亲密关系。
It surely is beyond doubt that the craft cannot possibly rival our sword under any circumstances, but would you find out whether the rumor has a grain of truth? I am asking a favor of you because you are a trustworthy man. If you accept my request, I’d be happy to hear it,” the instructor said. Then a pop-up message appeared in front of Weed’s eyes: Quest: A Mystery Sculptor Rumored to Have Visited the Royal Palace A rumor that a man who had mastered sculptural art did carve the moonlight has been prevalent in the royal court of Rosenheim Kingdom for long. Look into the rumor to determine whether it is true or not! Difficulty level: E Quest requirements: Close friendship with instructor reserved only for those who have not acquired Sculpture Mastery.

教练认可他始终对剑术充满激情。他本以为自己能取得胜利，然而“Whitespace”似乎并没有那么大的把握。他凭直觉觉得这个 quest 真是稀世珍宝，原因在于启动它需要满足极为复杂、多变的条件。你与教练的情谊深厚之至，几乎难以置信（heh），而且普通用户即使知道训练大厅的位置，也很少会去那里学习新技能。 而且，这样的情况极为罕见。 anyone愿意在Hall里呆住并不停地挥打scarecrow，以通过粗暴的方式提升他的统计数字，正如Weed所做。
Acknowledged as reliable by the instructor for a constant passion for Sword Mastery. Weed barely held a whisper of triumph at bay. His instinct told him that this quest was the rarest of the rare. This was because the quest had to meet very tricky conditions in order to get it started. Close friendship with the instructor—who would have ever thought of that? Most users in general don’t even know the location of the Training Hall, let alone visit it when they acquire a new skill. Moreover, it is a rare occasion that anyone is willing to get stuck in the Hall and thrash the scarecrow over and over to bring up his stats in the crudest way, as Weed had done.

谈到与导师深厚的友谊，几乎没有可能实现，除非像Weed这样的人接近他讨好，才能换取他的午餐份额。即使满足了上述所有条件，你仍然不得不在罗森海姆王国的塞拉堡 Citadel开始新的冒险，即便冒着一切风险，更不用提你还得找对时机来诋毁雕塑大师和导师。“真好！我马上就要饿穿肚子 starve死了。” 在难度级别E时，这个任务看上去很容易完成。weed nodded to the instructor. 我很荣幸接受它。尽管我不相信其中有什么onsense，但我将弄清楚如何雕刻月光。我表示感谢。我会托付给你这个任务。
Speaking of close friendship with the instructor, it is nearly impossible to achieve unless someone like Weed approaches him, fawning to earn a share of his lunch. Even with all the conditions above met you still have to begin your new adventure at the Citadel of Serabourg in Rosenheim Kingdom against all odds, not to mention that you have to find the right moment to slander Sculpture Mastery along with the instructor. “This is great. I’m about to go broke and starve to death. At difficulty level E, this quest looks like it’s easy to finish.” Weed nodded at the instructor. “I am honored to accept it. Although I do not believe any of the nonsense, I will find out what it was like carving the moonlight.” System message: You accepted the quest. “I appreciate it. I entrust you with this task.

老师说：“拿这点钱当 Your advice is to 去雕塑店看看，获取一些信息。”一块三铜的燕麦面包，虽然 tastesless（毫无味道），却能填饱肚子。那么，一银币等于一undred铜币，因此可以说，Weed 刚才只用一块 Retainer 付了相当于 sixty-six块燕麦面包的钱，再加上找零。 他坚信任务完成时，自己还能从导师那里获得更多的奖励。“好极了！短期内我不用担心食物短缺。”多年亲身经历过经常挨饿的体验，促使他尽可能避免营养不良。韦德高兴地收了两枚金币。
Take this money as a retainer,” the instructor said, handing over two silvers. “I give you my advice: visit the sculpture shop first and glean information from there.” A piece of rye bread, literally tasteless yet enough to fill the stomach, costs three coppers. Since a silver coin equals a hundred copper coins, it is safe to say Weed had just received the equivalent of sixty-six pieces of rye bread for the retainer, plus change. He was certain that once the quest was completed, he could expect more rewards from the instructor. “Great! I don’t need to worry about running out of bread for the time being.” Many years of first-hand experience of habitual famine persuaded him to avoid being malnourished at any cost. Weed was delighted after receiving two silver coins.

他想：一旦我完成这个任务，就必定会有更多的奖励。 “太棒了！我暂时不用担心 hunger。”由于多年养成的饥饿习惯，Weed已经有一条原则：无论如何也别饿肚子。任务提示说：首先参观雕塑商店以获取信息。在城市的各处有很多商店——武器店、装甲店、五金店……但雕塑商店最为荒凉。 室内只有 NPC 店主一位白发老者， weed 进入后礼貌地说道：“您好，先生。” 老者抬头表示道：“年轻人，你是来学雕塑的吗？” weed 即刻挥动手臂。 “不，不是！我只是来看东西的。”老者叹息一声。
He thought: once I complete the quest, there will surely be more rewards. “Great! I don’t need to worry about running out of bread for the time being.” Because of years of habitual famine, Weed already had one principle: never be malnourished at any cost. The quest prompt said: visit the sculpture shop first to glean information. In the city there were all sorts of shops—weapon shops, armor shops, general stores… but the sculpture shop was the most deserted. Inside, there were no other users, only the NPC shopkeeper, an old man with white hair. Weed went inside and said politely, “Hello, sir.” The old man looked up and said, “Young man, are you here to learn sculpture?” Weed quickly waved his hand. “No, no! I’m just here to look.” The old man sighed.

“唉，如今 sculpture 就是稀松软弱了，谁也不感兴趣了。现在人人去学剑术， magic， 或是些吃利害的技艺。只有极个别的人还爱好雕塑。” 玄土问随便地问：“我听说有人把月光雕刻成了雕塑。是真的吗？” 老者停了一会，笑了笑。“我也听说这个传言啊。 years ago, people said such a thing. When I was young, I was curious as well. But I've never seen it. Perhaps it's only a legend.” 玄土想：看来这只是一个谣言。 但是系统绝不会出这样一个陷阱。他重问了一遍：“你知道那个老雕刻家的名字吗？”老翁摇头答道：“没人知道。他是传奇人物而已。”weed点头离店。他自己暗想：系统一定想让我一步步调查清楚。
“Alas, very few people are interested in sculpture these days. Everyone goes to learn swordsmanship, magic, or profitable skills. Only a few still love sculpture.” Weed asked casually, “I heard someone once carved the moonlight with sculpture. Is that true?” The old man paused, then smiled. “You’ve heard that rumor too? Many years ago, people said such a thing. When I was young, I was curious as well. But I’ve never seen it. Perhaps it’s only a legend.” Weed thought: So it’s just a rumor. But the system wouldn’t give me a quest for nothing. He asked again, “Do you know the name of that master sculptor?” The old man shook his head. “No one knows. He was just a legendary figure.” Weed nodded and left the shop. In his heart he thought: the system must want me to investigate step by step.

由于雕塑店给了他很少的信息，下一步必须另寻它处。走出店铺后，他看到一些用户在街上交易。他们高喊：“买装备！卖武器！”其他人喊道：“需要一件更多的武器凑齐团队！去打怪兽吧！”weed没有停下脚步。他知道他的任务比商店提供的信息更为重要。他想道：尽管所有人都认为雕塑没用处，但系统却让我调查，所以我必定有特别的原因。如果我能完成这个任务，奖励肯定会非常惊人。 他随即忆起了老师的教诲——这则风闻来自Royal Knight Mellium。也许接下来的目标就是寻找那位骑士。 Weed眼中一瞬闪过了期待之光。他握紧拳头沉思：这场征途或许能改写我的命运！
Since the sculpture shop gave me little information, the next step must be elsewhere. Walking out, he saw some users trading in the street. They shouted, “Buy armor! Sell weapons!” Others shouted, “Need one more for the party! Going monster hunting!” Weed didn’t stop. He knew his quest was more important. He thought: Even though everyone thinks sculpture is useless, the system asked me to investigate, so there must be a special reason. If I complete it, the reward will surely be extraordinary. Then he remembered the instructor’s words: the rumor had come from Royal Knight Mellium. Perhaps the next target was to find that knight. A spark of expectation flashed in Weed’s eyes. He clenched his fist and thought: This quest might change my destiny!

“今天，小学五年级学生小野比不想写作业，他不想做任何事情，所以他去找大头。大头拿出一个新玩意儿，叫‘万用手指通灵器’。”小野按下按钮，许多小机器人突然出现在房间中。这些机器人帮他完成作业，洗衣服，做饭菜。
"Today, elementary school student Nobita was very lazy. He didn’t want to do his homework, so he went to find Doraemon. Doraemon took out a new gadget called the “All-Purpose Little Helper.” Nobita pressed a button and many little robots appeared in the room. The robots did his homework, washed the clothes, and cooked the meals.

起初一切都很顺利。Nobita 可以在手机上玩耍，在电视旁观看，在床上睡觉。然而，机器人过于认真，他们把 everything 整得非常整洁，以至于 Nobita 的玩具和连他的朋友们都成了“任务”出现在清单上。当 Shizuka 来借书时，机器人将书放入了一个箱子中，使其无法取出。而当 Gian 来玩时，机器人却把他的零食当作垃圾处理掉了。所有人都愤怒了。
At first everything was fine. Nobita could play on his phone, watch TV, and even sleep. But the robots were too earnest; they tidied everything up so well that Nobita’s toys and even his friends became “tasks” on a checklist. When Shizuka came to borrow a book, the robot put the book into a box so it couldn’t be taken out. When Gian came to play, the robot threw his snacks away as garbage. Everyone got angry.

小野兽感到焦虑，希望大雄取回所有机器人。大雄说：“不能把所有的责任交给机器。朋友和家人需要你亲自对待。”小野兽领悟到教训：做事情要用心，不只是省力。于是他关掉万能小帮手，道歉，帮助朋友找回东西，并自己改写作业。
Nobita became anxious and wanted Doraemon to take the robots back. Doraemon said, “You can’t give all your responsibilities to machines. Friends and family need to be treated by you personally.” Nobita learned a lesson: do things with care, not just to save effort. So he turned off the All-Purpose Little Helper, apologized, helped his friends recover their things, and rewrote his homework himself.

结局everyone都笑出了。尽管牛ritten有时候还想懒，但他明白真正的幸福是与朋友一起做事情得来的。“有个经常独自散步的人。他的名字不重要；但心却在走。他不想去大城市，也不想要很多东西；他只想要找到自己。”
In the end, everyone laughed. Although Nobita still wanted to be lazy sometimes, he understood that true happiness comes from doing things together with friends." "There was a man who often walked alone. His name was unimportant; what mattered was that his heart was walking. He did not want to go to the big city, nor did he want many things; he only wanted to find himself.

深夜他看见了月亮。月亮非常洁白，非常安静。他向月亮说话，月亮没有回答，可是他觉得自己被听见了。天上的星星在微笑，微风沿街道走过，带来了来自远方的耳语。
At night he saw the moon. The moon was very white, very quiet. He spoke to the moon; the moon did not answer, but he felt heard. The stars were smiling, the wind walked along the road, bringing voices from far away.

他遇见一朵花。那朵花很小很美。花儿问：“你为什么这样走路？”他回答道：“我想了解自己；我想知道什么是爱情。”花儿笑了起来，她的笑像水一样，像家中亮堂堂的光。
He met a flower. The flower was small and beautiful. The flower said, “Why do you walk like this?” He said, “I want to understand myself; I want to know what love is.” The flower smiled; its smile sounded like water, like the light in a home.

一天，他看见一个孩子在哭。这个孩子没有家，不知道方向。他坐在地上，给孩子喝水、吃饭、戴件外套。孩子慢慢露出笑容，眼中透着温暖的光芒。他知道帮助别人就是在帮助自己。
One day he saw a child crying. The child had no home and did not know the way. He sat down, gave the child water, gave the child food, and gave the child a small coat. The child slowly smiled; there was light in the child’s eyes. He knew that helping others was helping himself.

他学会了倾听内心的声音。有时候心是暖的，有时候冷的。有时心如大海，有狂风作伴；有时心似小溪，缓缓流淌。但每次他都不会害怕，因为这条路脚下是他的，天上是明月。
He learned to listen to the voice inside his heart. Sometimes the heart was warm, sometimes cold. Sometimes the heart was like the sea, with strong winds; sometimes like a little river, flowing slowly. But each time he was not afraid, because the road was under his feet and the moon above.

“他遇到了许多人物。朋友给予了他帮助；敌人教会了他如何坚定不移。每个人都是镜子，让他看清了自己。所以，他不再匆匆忙忙或拖拖拉拉；他学会了与世界呼吸。”
He met many people, friends and enemies. Friends gave him a hand; enemies taught him how to stand firm. Each person was a mirror, letting him see himself. So he no longer walked too fast nor too slow; he learned to breathe with the world.

那雨滴异常寂静，仿佛真理从天而降。他闭上了眼睛，回忆起了所有欢笑与泪水。他感觉自己的心慢慢张开，如同夜间的花儿绽放。那时他停在山顶，看见了雨。
Once he stopped on a mountain and saw the rain. The rain was very quiet, like truth falling from the sky. He closed his eyes and remembered all the laughter and the tears. He felt his heart slowly open, like a flower blooming at night. In that moment he knew love had always been there—not something outside, but inside him.

后来，他带着许多传奇经历回到村庄。他的眼睛明亮了许多，双手也温暖了许多。他不再问那么多“为什么”，因为他明白了：道路是爱，行走是爱，看见他人并且帮助他人就是回归于自己本身。
Later he returned to the village with many stories. There was more light in his eyes and more warmth in his hands. He no longer asked so many whys, because he understood: the road is love, walking is love, seeing others and helping others is coming back to oneself.

人们问他变得这般模样是怎么回事，他笑了笑说：“只求答案不偿矢志。心会领你回家。”夜间的月亮依旧皎洁，他知道路途漫长，可他并不害怕，因有光、风、伴和爱伴在身旁。
People asked him how he had become this way. He smiled and said, “Don’t only seek answers—follow your heart. The heart will lead you home.” At night the moon was still that white; he knew the road was long, but he was not afraid, for there was light, wind, friends, and love." "Li Ming plays the game ""The Moonlight Sculptor"" at home; his life is quiet. He logs in every day, does quests, earns money, and chats with friends.

有一天，他想变得更强，并且创造一件美丽的雕塑，让更多人认识他。他觉得自己需要更多的钱和朋友。
One day, he wants to become stronger and create a beautiful sculpture that will make many people recognize him. He feels he needs more money and more friends.

他离开了熟悉的区域，进入了一个新的游戏地图，这个地图上充满了各种怪物和丰富的机遇。他不知道方向，但决定试试看。
He leaves the familiar area and goes to a new game map, where there are many monsters and many opportunities. He doesn't know the way, but he decides to give it a try.

在新地图上，他获得了新的技能，结识了新的朋友，并做了大量的工作。他花费时间和精力制作小型雕塑，逐渐崭露头角，但同时也遇到了许多困难。
In the new map, he learns new skills, meets new friends, and does a lot of work. He spends time and effort making small sculptures, slowly gaining fame, but he also encounters many difficulties.

最后，他打造了一件非常特别的作品；许多人都过来欣赏，并为他颁发了奖项。他非常高兴，感受到自己的付出得到了回报。
Finally, he creates a very special sculpture; many people come to see it and reward him. He is very happy and feels his efforts have paid off.

然而，他也不得不付出代价。他把大量时间用在了上面，睡眠不足，与老朋友的接触减少了许多。他开始怀念过去平静的生活。
However, he also pays a price. He spends a lot of time, loses rest, and has less contact with old friends. He begins to miss his formerly peaceful life.

他带着更多的经验和新朋友回家了。他知道他必须平衡工作与生活，并已学会更好地管理自己的时间了。
He returns home with more experience and new friends. He knows he must balance work and life and has learned to manage his time better.

最后，他在游戏中和现实生活中都变得更好了。他继续制作雕塑，但也经常回家与家人团聚。他的生活发生了变化，他找到了新的幸福。“从前，有一个叫连的小女孩。”
In the end he becomes better both in the game and in real life. He continues making sculptures but also often goes home to be with his family. His life has changed, and he has found new happiness." "Once upon a time there was a little girl named Lian. She lived in a small village; life was quiet, and her heart was quiet too.

一天，一阵风从村子吹过，那里的花一片片合上了 bloom. 蔷薇想：我一定会让花儿重新绽放。我真的希望能帮助每一个人.
One day a wind came through the village, and the flowers there slowly stopped opening. Lian thought: I will make the flowers bloom. I really want to help everyone.

连走了进去了远山林。森林里一片漆黑静悄悄的——她从未游览过的地方。
Lian walked into the forest of the distant mountains. The forest was dark and still — a place she had never been.

她遇到一头老鹿，能说话。老鹿说：要寻找到那光明之花，你得走很多条路，学很多东西。连跟着老鹿学会了听风，看夜间的路，还有读心向。
She met an old deer that could speak. The old deer said: To find the flower of light, you must travel many roads and learn many things. Lian followed the old deer, learning to listen to the wind, to see the path at night, and to read the direction of the heart.

最后，他们来到一个小湖边，湖面上有一个发光的花。连非常高兴，伸出手去取它。可是水太冷了，风又很大，她几次想要放手，但都坚持不懈地努力。最后，她终于提起了那个花。
At last they came to a small lake, and in the lake was a glowing flower. Lian was very happy and reached out to take it. The water was very cold and the wind was strong; several times she thought of letting go, but she did not. She struggled and at last lifted the flower.

回家的路很长。连长有些疲惫，心里略微有些疼痛，但是她想到村庄里的人和那些花儿，便咬牙坚持向前走去。
The road home was long. Lian was tired and a little hurt, but she thought of the people in the village and how the flowers would look, and so she kept going.

在村庄里，连把那盆亮着光的花放在村中心。花慢慢开了，村子里又亮堂堂了。乡亲们欢呼雀跃，原来他们像连一样，学会倾听风声，凝视内心，帮助和关心他人。连再也不只是个安静的小姑娘啦！她成了整个村庄的灯塔，心里也更有温度了。有一家人：父亲带着两个儿子同住一室。小儿子留在家中，过着安宁和平的生活。
Back in the village, Lian placed the glowing flower in the village center. The flower slowly opened, and the village brightened again. People were joyful, and they learned, like Lian, to listen to the wind, look into their hearts, and help one another. Lian was no longer just a quiet little girl — she became the village’s light, with a greater warmth in her heart." "There was a family: a father and two sons living together. The younger son stayed at home and lived peacefully.

年长的儿子渴望获得自由与金钱，因此他请求父亲分享家产。年长的儿子想要前往遥远的城市，并随心所欲地生活。
The younger son wanted freedom and lots of money, so he asked his father for his share of the inheritance. He wanted to go to a far city and do as he pleased.

他离开家了，去了城市，结识了新朋友，生活非常热闹。他花了许多钱在美味的食物和精致的东西上，他的日子像梦一样。
He left home, went to the city, met new friends, and life was fast and lively. He spent money on delicious food and fine things; his days felt like a dream.

时光飞逝，钱花光了，他的朋友也离开了。他不得不做非常辛苦的工作；生活变得苦涩，他也感到孤单和饥饿。
Time passed quickly, the money ran out, and his friends left. He had to do very hard work; life became bitter, and he felt lonely and hungry.

念及家乡与父亲，他意识到自己犯了错误，极度渴望返回。决心回乡，并请求父亲将他带回作工人。
He thought of home and his father, realized he had been wrong, and desperately wanted to return. He decided to go back and ask his father to take him back as a worker.

当他在家中归来后，他父亲看见他在院子里等着，于是跑出去拥抱了他，并一直喊着“别害怕”。一家人非常高兴，准备了一顿饭，大家一起来吃。
When he returned home, his father saw him waiting outside the yard, ran out, embraced him, and kept saying, “Don’t be afraid.” The family was very happy, prepared a meal, and everyone ate together.

儿子在家休息，学习了爱与感恩，他的心因此转变了——他不再只是为自我活着。他学会了与家人相处，并在和平与幸福中生活。我无法以诺姆·麦当德兰的原声表达，但可以写出风格相似、曲折且带点幽默感的新故事。
The younger son rested at home, learned love and gratitude, and his heart changed—he no longer thought only of himself. He learned to be with his family and lived in peace and happiness." "I can’t write in the exact voice of Norm Macdonald, but I can write a new story with a similar meandering, dry, and funny tone.

有个叫王小明的人。他爱说爱道，但不想做大事。有一天，他去买面包。面包房很小，只有一只猫看着门。这只猫不与他说话，但却很机灵。
There was a man named Wang Xiaoming. He liked talking a lot, but he didn’t want to do anything big. One day he went to buy bread. The bakery was tiny, with only a cat watching the door. The cat didn’t speak to him, but it looked clever.

王小明走进去，看见许多面包。他心想：“我只吃一个就行了。”可每一个面包都有个故事。一个看上去像老师，一个看上去像老朋友，还有一个看上去像演员，他怎么也想不起来他的名字。时间像糖一样融化的时刻，王小明就这样站着。
Wang Xiaoming walked in and saw many loaves. He thought, “I only need one.” But each loaf seemed to have a story. One looked like a teacher, another like an old friend, and another like an actor whose name he couldn’t remember. Wang Xiaoming stood there while time melted like sugar.

他挑了最普通的面包。营业员问：“茶吗？” 王小明答道：“可以。” 茶很烫，但他不想喝太多。他啜了一口，看着猫。猫突然跳上桌子，仿佛在等笑话。王小明想了一个笑话，却记不起结尾。他笑了一下，商店里的人也笑了——每个人心里都有自己的笑话。
He finally picked the plainest loaf. The shopkeeper asked, “Tea?” Wang Xiaoming said, “Sure.” The tea was hot, but he didn’t want to drink too much. He sipped and watched the cat. The cat suddenly jumped on the table, as if waiting for a joke. Wang Xiaoming came up with a joke but forgot the punchline. He laughed, and the people in the shop laughed too — everyone laughing because there was no ending.

天空有些阴沉，王小明觉得恰到好处。他想如果世界像面包一样，或许我们都需要茶和一只猫。然后他拿着面包和一个未完的笑话回家。路上有一只鸟问他：“那个笑话怎么样？”他回答说：“可能好笑，也可能不好笑。”接着那只鸟飞走了，好像故事结束了，但实际上并没有。
Outside, the sky was a bit gray, and Wang Xiaoming felt it fit. He thought if the world were bread, maybe we all need a bit of tea and a cat. Then he walked home with the bread and an unfinished joke. A bird on the road asked him, “Was that joke funny?” He answered, “Maybe funny, maybe not.” The bird flew away like the end of a story, but not really.

王小明回家了，把面包放在桌子上，然后看着窗外。一只孩子在外面追赶一只鸭子。那只鸭子没有跑，停下来，好像在等孩子说完整话。王小明吃掉了面包，但他记得那个 joke并没有结尾。他觉得没问题，因为有时候故事不需要结尾——只需要茶、一只猫、一只鸭子和愿意开怀大笑的人。“我有一个朋友叫李明。李明真的很喜欢鱼。” 那种餐馆里可能价格昂贵的鱼，不是游荡于市场、让你驻足欣赏，然后又仿佛通过你的眼神表示：“别看我，我可能会走开。” 有一天，我们决定去买鱼。
Wang Xiaoming got home, put the bread on the table, and looked out the window. A child outside was chasing a duck. The duck didn’t run; it stopped, as if waiting for the child to finish speaking. Wang Xiaoming ate the bread, but he remembered the joke without an ending. He felt fine about that, because sometimes stories don’t need an ending — just tea, a cat, a duck, and someone willing to laugh." "I have a friend named Li Ming. Li Ming really likes fish. Not the kind that’s expensive at restaurants, but the kind that wanders around the market, gives you a look, then with its eyes seems to say, “Don’t look at me, I might walk away.” One day we decided to go buy fish.

我喊道：“让我们去买鱼吧。”李明抬起头看了看我，轻轻 nods，似乎我在说一件很重要的事。他戴着一顶旧帽子，但他却说帽子能记住 things。记忆很宝贵，可帽子不值钱，但是他认真。于是我们出发了。
I said, “Let’s go buy fish.” Li Ming looked at me and nodded slowly, as if I had said something important. He wore a hat — an old hat — but he said hats hold memories. Memories are precious, the hat isn’t, but he was serious. So we set off.

在路上，我们看到一只猫。这只猫看见了我们，它的大眼睛像两颗小灯泡一样。李明停了下来和猫交谈起来。我不知道他说了些什么，等他说完之后，他就笑了。我问他：“猫会回答您吗？”他摇摇头，说：“猫不会说话，但他们能思考。”我只觉得好笑，并不是猫真会说话，有时候它们的眼睛好像在说话呢。
On the way we saw a cat. The cat saw us and its eyes were round like two little lights. Li Ming stopped to talk to the cat. I didn’t know what he said; after he spoke he laughed. I asked him, “Does the cat answer you?” He shrugged and said, “Cats don’t speak, but they think.” I just thought it was funny, because cats really don’t speak, but sometimes their eyes seem to be talking.

在市场里，有许多鱼。老板娘催我们去尝那条鱼。她拿着鱼，结果鱼扑腾了一下，水溅得到处都是。李明看着这条鱼，说：“它看上去像一位老师。”我问为什么，他解释道：“老师们常常看起来好像知道很多事情，但其实不说出来。”我大笑了一下，思考了一会儿，觉得李明说的有道理。
At the market, there were many fish. The shopkeeper urged us to try that one fish. He held the fish in his hands; it flapped and water splashed everywhere. Li Ming looked at the fish and said, “It looks like a teacher.” I asked why; he said, “Teachers often look at people as if they know many things, but they say nothing.” I laughed, thought about it, and felt Li Ming had a point.

我们买了鱼。在路上我们遇到了一只老鼠。老鼠看见了鱼篓，眼睛亮了起来。老鼠走得很慢，好像在念一本书。李明看见了，立刻紧握住鱼篓。我问他：“你怕老鼠吗？”他说：“我不怕老鼠；我怕他们知道我的秘密。”当时我想，每个人都有自己的秘密，就像鱼鳞，不为他人所知。
We bought the fish. On the way home we met a mouse. The mouse saw the fish bag and its eyes lit up. The mouse walked slowly, as if reading a book. Li Ming saw it and immediately hugged the fish bag tight. I asked him, “Are you afraid of mice?” He said, “I’m not afraid of mice; I’m afraid they’ll know my secrets.” At that moment I thought everyone has some secrets, like fish scales, not visible to others.

在家里，我把鱼放进厨房，开始想晚饭的事。李明坐在椅子上，开始 tells 长长的故事。故事里有个人想要把整个世界变成一碗汤，但是他没有锅。这个故事很奇怪 很有趣。每到有趣的地方他会停顿一下看看我笑不笑。有时候我笑 周有时候我不笑 但是我知道他的故事就像一条鱼一样 不走寻常路。
Back home, I put the fish in the kitchen and started thinking about dinner. Li Ming sat in a chair and began telling a long story. In the story a man wanted to turn the world into a bowl of soup, but he had no pot. The story was strange and very funny. Whenever he reached a funny part he would pause and watch to see if I laughed. Sometimes I laughed, sometimes I didn’t, but I knew his story swam like a fish, never following ordinary paths.

最后，我们煮了鱼放在桌子上。鱼香味扑鼻，我们大家一起吃了。吃着吃着，李明说：“吃鱼就像听故事一样：你不知道下一口会是什么滋味儿，但你知道总会有滋味。”我认为他的话是对的，他说话时很慢，好像每个字都沉在水里似的。我忍不住笑了起来，还想起了那只猫、那只老鼠和那顶帽子。
Finally we cooked the fish and put it on the table. The fish smelled good and we ate together. While eating Li Ming said, “Eating fish is like listening to a story; you don’t know what the next bite will taste like, but you know there will be taste.” I thought he was right; he spoke slowly, as if each word swam in water. I laughed, and remembered the cat and the mouse and his hat.

晚饭后，我们清理了桌子。李明把他的帽子又拿回了桌子。他像在看一本小说一样看着它，随后说这条帽子应该去旅游。我说没问题，我们去下一个市场看看那里有没有更多会说话的鱼或思考的猫。李明点点头，我们都笑了。“孙悟空非常聪明也非常勇敢。一天，他跟着唐僧走在路上。” 路上出现了一只怪兽。这只怪兽看到了唐僧，便说道：“我饿了，想吃他。”
After dinner we cleared the table. Li Ming put his hat back on the table. He looked at it like he was reading a book, then said the hat should go traveling. I said fine, we could go to the next market to see if there were more talking fish or thinking cats. Li Ming nodded, and we laughed again. Our laughter echoed in the kitchen like the sound of fish swimming in water." "Sun Wukong was very smart and very brave. One day, he was walking with his master, Tang Monk. On the road, a monster appeared. The monster saw Tang Monk and said, “I want to eat him!”

悟空 听到了这句话， 笑了。
Sun Wukong heard this and laughed: “You want to eat my master? No way!”

孙悟空立即变得很大，并取出金箍棒。妖精害怕起来，开始逃跑了。孙悟空追赶着妖精，一棍子打出去了。妖精凄厉地叫喊道：‘我再也不敢了！我要跑了！’
He immediately grew large and pulled out his golden staff. The monster was afraid and started to run. Sun Wukong chased the monster and struck him once. The monster cried out: “I don’t dare anymore! I will leave!”

唐僧说：“悟空啊，你真棒，谢谢你救了我。” 孙悟空回答道：“师父，我们还有很长的路要走。不要担心，我一定会保护好你的。”“零分！零分！” “诺 bitea 在这次考试中的得分是零。”
Tang Monk said, “Wukong, you are really good. Thank you for saving me.” Sun Wukong said, “Master, we still have a long road to travel. Don’t worry, I will always protect you.”" """Nobita’s Zero Marks on the Test""

诺bita这次考试他又得了零分，因为他妈妈会生气而感到害怕。
Nobita got zero marks on his test again today. He was scared because his mom would be angry.

小雄鱼说：“别担心！我有一块‘测验面包’！”这种面包很特别——吃了之后，你就能记住教科书上的所有知识。
Doraemon said, “Don’t worry! I have ‘Test Bread’!” This bread was special—if you ate it, you could remember everything from the textbook.

小say，他吃了面包然后睡着了。
Nobita was happy. He ate the bread and then… fell asleep!

下次考试那天上午， Nobito拿着试卷走了出来，只见满是数字的算式。测词本只能识别繁体字的内容。
The next day during the test, Nobita opened the exam paper and saw math problems! But the “Test Bread” only worked for Chinese textbook words.

石pal获得零分又一次。德须 kinetic笑著说：”糟糕！我给错了面包——那是‘睡食’！”
Nobita got zero marks again. Doraemon laughed and said, “Oops! I gave you the wrong bread—that was ‘Sleep Bread’!”

诺Bita哭道，“大雄，你真是最差的！”这是个关于生日礼物的话题。

今天是三叶兽的生日，他非常高兴是因为大 mascot答应了送他特别的礼物。
Today was Nobita’s birthday, and he was very happy because Doraemon promised him a special gift.

早上，北斗猫跑去找大雄问：“我的礼物呢？”大雄笑着回答道：“别急着找，先吃早餐再说！”
In the morning, Nobita ran to Doraemon and asked, “Where’s my gift?” Doraemon smiled and said, “Don’t rush, eat breakfast first!”

吃完早餐后， Nobita 问了一遍：“能不能拿回我的礼物了？”Doraemon 摸了摸口袋，脸色变得难看了，说：“哎呀！我的礼物不见了！”
After breakfast, Nobita asked again, “Can I have my gift now?” Doraemon checked his pocket and suddenly looked worried: “Oh no! The gift is gone!”

结果出来，多罗米诺已经把礼物放在桌子上了，而且有个贼偷走了它！
It turned out that Doraemon had left the gift on the table, and a thief had stolen it! Nobita was so sad that he almost cried.

德机器人迅速取出“时间套索”，将桌子用它包起来。桌又回到了昨天的状态，礼物也重新出现了！
Doraemon quickly took out the “Time Kerchief” and wrapped the table with it. The table returned to its state from yesterday, and the gift reappeared!

野兽君开心地拆开礼物，发现了一个“愿望气球”。只要对着这个气球说出来你的愿望，它就会实现哦！
Nobita happily opened the gift and found a “Wish Balloon.” Just say a wish to the balloon, and it would come true.

他立即说，“我想要很多很多钱！”“气球破了”，然后没事情发生。
Nobita immediately said, “I want lots and lots of money!” The balloon went pop and nothing happened.

大 grapeman 摇了搖頭。「這个氣球只能实现簡單的愿望，比如'我想要冰淇凌'或者'我想要飛行'。」
Doraemon shook his head. “This balloon only works for simple wishes, like ‘I want ice cream’ or ‘I want to fly.’”

Nobita 思考片刻说：“然后……我想飞！”热气球变得更大，载着他飞上了天空。
Nobita thought for a moment and said, “Then… I want to fly!” The balloon grew bigger and carried Nobita into the sky.

但小次忘记了怎么降落。他大喊道，‘快帮忙！’二郎神迅速取出他的竹蜻蜓，飞起拯救他。

但小次忘记了怎么降落。他大喊道，‘快帮忙！’二郎神迅速取出他的竹蜻蜓，飞起拯救他。

但小次忘记了怎么降落。他大喊道，‘快帮忙！’二郎神迅速取出他的竹蜻蜓，飞起拯救他。
But Nobita forgot how to come down. He shouted, “Help!” Doraemon quickly took out his bamboo-copter and flew up to save him.

突然，气球破裂，Nobita 落地！幸运地，Doraoem 抓住他。
Suddenly, the balloon burst, and Nobita fell! Luckily, Doraemon caught him.

Nobita坐在地上，说：“这个礼物太危险了！” 灵大郎 笑着说：“对不起，下次我给你一个更好的！”
Nobita sat on the ground and said, “This gift is too dangerous!” Doraemon laughed awkwardly. “Sorry, next time I’ll give you a better one!”

克劳迪厄斯的音乐大赛正好，牛太母叫他们去吃蛋糕。牛太一见就忘了他的不快，高高兴兴地跑进了屋子里。大雄深吸一口气，心想：“好啊！他爱吃蛋糕！”
Just then, Nobita’s mom called them for cake. Nobita immediately forgot his anger and ran inside happily. Doraemon sighed in relief, thinking, “Good thing he loves cake!”" """Kvothe's Music Contest""

科罗特是大学的最贫困学生，但是，他声音非常 Beautiful。一天，他听说了镇上有一个音乐比赛——头等奖是100枚金币！
Kvothe was the poorest student at the University, but he could sing beautifully. One day, he heard about a music contest in town - first prize was 100 gold coins!

心灵闪现！Kvothe心想。这个能为我交学费吗？
""Perfect!"" Kvothe thought. ""This can pay my tuition.""

在比赛当天，科夫带了他的竖琴来到广场上。但其他人穿着华丽的衣服，而他只剩下一件旧外套。
On contest day, Kvothe brought his lute to the square. But he noticed all other contestants wore fine clothes, while he only had his old coat.

轮到Kvothe的时候，他唱了一首古老的《阿德姆》诗。他的嗓子像夜莺般动听，整个观众席无语地倾听。
When Kvothe's turn came, he played an ancient Adem poem. His voice was as lovely as a nightingale's, and the crowd listened in silence.

突然！弦断了！
Suddenly - snap! A lute string broke! The audience gasped.

Kvothe不慌张。他放下小提琴，用 whistle 完结了歌曲。他的 whistle 比小提琴还要美妙，就像春天的风穿过树林一样。
But Kvothe didn't panic. He set down the lute and finished the song by whistling. His whistle was even more beautiful than the lute, like spring wind through trees.

评委宣布道：特等奖奖给了...一位衣衫破旧的小孩！
